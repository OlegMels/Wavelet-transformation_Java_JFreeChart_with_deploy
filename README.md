# Wavelet-Transformation for trigonometric functions defined parametrically
## Info
This project displays transformations for functions with basis functions of Gauss distribution and wavelet Morlet. First Tab shows trigonometric function itself, second and third shows transformation basises, fourth shows transformation with conversion window being pulled through a space axis for both basis finctions, fifth shows transformation with conversion window being pulled through a frequency axis for both basis functions, sixth and seventh tabs shows a image of transformation with window goes though both of the axises for Gauss distribution and wavelet Morlet basis.
